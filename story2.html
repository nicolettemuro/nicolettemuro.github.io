  <p> The United States faced its highest-recorded influenza outbreak in history last year so people are encouraged to get their flu shots as the flu season progresses, health officials say.  </p>

  <p> “Cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza now are gradually increasing across the country. They are a reminder that everyone older than 6 months of age should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Influenza is serious: it causes thousands to be hospitalized and die each year. Influenza vaccine can prevent many of these illnesses and it can avert the complications of pneumonia and needing emergency care. The vaccine also makes it less likely that you will spread the flu virus to others, making them sick in turn. Thus, vaccination protects the individual as well as contributing to a healthier community,” said William Schaffner, Professor of Preventive Medicine and Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. </p>

<p> The cases shown in this data are all from New York recorded during October and November. The end of November saw the highest percentage of cases with a total of 46. 2017 was considered the worst year for Influenza in the United States according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and it is too soon to predict the outcome of the 2018 flu season because it goes until March. Health officials recommend getting a flu shot between October and November but there's still time to get one. Check your local Rite-Aid, CVS Pharmacy or doctor's office for a shot. Most influenza shots are free or cost as little as $5 at a walk-in center.

  <p> Flu shots are the most proactive measure to take this season against fighting the flu. Even healthy people can be at risk unknowingly. </p>

  <p> "Prevention remains the most effective method to stop the spread of the flu. Even people who are healthy, if unvaccinated, can easily spread the flu virus to family members, friends or co-workers,” said Dr. Howard Zucker, New York State Department of Health Commissioner. </p>
