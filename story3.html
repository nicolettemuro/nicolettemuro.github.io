    <p> Consumers are advised to avoid eating Romaine lettuce after strains of E.Coli were identified in 12 different states as of Nov. 26. Research conducted by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the disease originates in raw Romaine grown in Central and Northern California.</p>

<p> "In the United States, it’s estimated that a large percentage of foodborne illnesses are caused by germs on fresh produce. Recent analyses in the United States suggest that vegetable row crops, which include leafy greens, are a major source of E. coli O157 infections, responsible for as many as 40% of E. coli O157 illnesses transmitted by foods," said Dr. Matthew Wise, deputy branch chief for outbreak response at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>

<p> If Romaine is ingested, consumers are warned to be on the look-out for symptoms of the E.Coli strain. If symptoms do arise, seek medical attention immediately. </p>

<p> "These bacteria are able to cause severe illness in certain high-risk individuals: the very young, the elderly and the immunocompromised. Affected individuals can develop a condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can cause kidney failure and even death. Most of the time, however, individuals do recover within a few weeks," said Dr. Bindu Mayi, Professor of Microbiology at Nova Southeastern University.

<p> "The symptoms of E. coli infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. People usually get sick three to four days after swallowing the germ. Most people recover within a week. However, some people develop a serious type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)," said Dr.Wise. </p>

<p> The CDC says not to eat unlabeled lettuce and if infected items are brought into the home to thoroughly wash all surfaces including refrigerators where they may have been placed.  </p>

<p> Since the original CDC report, an additional nine people were infected in 15 different states by the E.Coli outbreak. </p>
