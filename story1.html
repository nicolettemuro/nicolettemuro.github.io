<p>Community board two  pushed the city to expand their plan to limit street congestion anticipated by the L-Train shutdown by restricting car drivers.</p>


<blockquote>"Traffic and congestion are always huge issues,"said Shirley Secunda,chair of traffic and transportation."There will be an impact on people driving into the city on Fridays and Saturdays."</blockquote>

<p>"The L-train is the biggest issue,”said Bob Gormley, district manager.It will have a major impact on the community."</p>

<p>To discourage people from driving or taking Ubers, the city is implementing a High-Occupancy Vehicle rule. Cars carrying less than three passengers won’t be allowed over the Williamsburg Bridge, and this rule applies 24-hours a day according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/nyregion/l-train-shutdown-14th-street.htm">The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p> “HOV 3 is over the Williamsburg Bridge for now, but we’d like to have this rule all over Manhattan and Brooklyn as well. It’s going to be insane if we don’t,” said Secunda</p>

  <p> Cameras will be installed, and New York Police Department officers will be stationed on 14th street to enforce this rule. The same will apply for taxis according to <a href=" https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/09/17/manhattan-community-board-to-city-get-real-on-l-train-plan/">NYC Streets Blog</a>.</p>

  <p> Residents are encouraged by district two to plan alternative travel routes because of the estimated shutdown in early October. Electric buses and extended train lines are two options offered for local people struggling to find new transportation methods according to <a href=" https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/nyregion/l-train-shutdown-14th-street.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p>"There will be 40 buses a minute to substitute for the trains,” said Secunda. “There’s a lot of people who are still going to be hung up so the city is doing a busway on 14th street and trying to have no vehicular traffic at certain hours of the day. They have to encourage people not to drive into the city."</p>

  <p> The traffic and transportation committee’s attempt to divert people from driving into the city is valid according to Secunda, and with less public train options, people will resort to personal transportation methods. Secunda estimates thousands of new drivers and bikers will appear in Manhattan as a result of the shutdown.</p>

  <p> SoHo and Chinatown face the largest impact of the shutdown, with buses and drivers dropping off and picking up passengers near subway stops in both of these community districts. Delancey Street, Kemare Street and Cleveland Place will face the most congestion from buses according to The New York Times <a href=" https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/nyregion/l-train-shutdown-14th-street.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>

  <p>Local resident Pete Davis said a rally was held on Sept. 5 by elected officials to voice opinions about the areas of district two impacted by L-Train shutdown congestion, specifically the southeast corner of the community. Community members shared ideas for new bus routes.</p>

  <p>The Department of Transportation and The New York City Transit will continue to adjust their plan as necessary and take careful watch over the bus services and vehicle restrictions. As of right now, The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is still deciding on price ranges for public bus use according to <a href=" https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/09/17/manhattan-community-board-to-city-get-real-on-l-train-plan/">NYC Streets Blog</a>.</p>

  <p> “We need a bigger commitment from the M.T.A to get this sorted out,” said Valerie De La Rosa, community board two member.</p>
